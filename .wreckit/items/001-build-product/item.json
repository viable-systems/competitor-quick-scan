  "overview": "Build a production-ready web TOOL called \"Competitor Quick Scan\".\n\nA focused tool for analyzing competitors by entering their URL or company name. Uses AI to produce a structured competitive analysis in seconds.\n\n## Product Spec (FOLLOW THIS EXACTLY)\nProblem: Founders need to quickly research competitors without expensive tools\nCore Loop: User enters a company URL or name -> App analyzes with AI -> User gets a competitive report\nUser Input: A search input where the user enters a competitor company name or website URL\nTransformation: Use Anthropic Claude API to produce a structured competitive analysis\nOutput: A formatted analysis card with copy-to-clipboard and download buttons\n\nAdditional features:\n- URL or company name input\n- AI-powered competitive analysis\n- Copyable markdown report\n- Download as markdown\n\n## Architecture Requirements\n1. MUST have a form/input on the main page where the user provides data\n2. MUST have at least one API route (src/app/api/) that processes the input\n3. MUST display results that change based on user input\n4. MUST have a way to copy/download/export the output\n5. MUST NOT have hardcoded data arrays with 5+ items displayed in grids — if you're tempted to create a catalog, STOP and build a tool instead\n\n## What NOT to Build\n- Static dashboards with fake metrics\n- Technology catalogs with hardcoded entries\n- Comparison grids with pre-filled data\n- Landing pages without working tools\n\n## Tech Stack (already configured)\nNext.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS. Add npm packages as needed.\nFor AI features: use Anthropic SDK with process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n\nAfter implementation, `npm run build` must succeed with zero errors.",
