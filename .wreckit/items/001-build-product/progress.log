### Key Technical Decisions

1. **React 19 + Next.js 15**: Used latest versions with built-in TypeScript support
2. **Tailwind CSS v4**: Required @tailwindcss/postcss plugin for PostCSS integration
3. **Anthropic SDK**: Official @anthropic-ai/sdk for API calls
4. **Claude Model**: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 for balance of speed and quality
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript strict mode with custom React type declarations
6. **Error Handling**: User-friendly messages with server-side logging
7. **Export Format**: Both JSON (for display) and markdown (for export)

**New Files:**
- src/types/analysis.ts - TypeScript interfaces

### Architecture Compliance

✅ Input → Transform → Output pattern followed
✅ Form/input on main page for user data
